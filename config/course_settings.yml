  # Course Description (Rich Text with Learning Outcomes)
  description: |
    <h3>🎯 Course Overview</h3>
    <p>This template demonstrates evidence-based gamification that enhances learning 
    without compromising academic rigor. Students progress through a carefully designed 
    skill tree, earning experience points (XP) and badges that reflect genuine mastery 
    of learning objectives.</p>
    
    <h3>🎮 Gamification Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Skill Tree Progression:</strong> Visual learning paths with clear prerequisites</li>
      <li><strong>Experience Points:</strong> Quantified progress tied to learning outcomes</li>
      <li><strong>Achievement Badges:</strong> Recognition for diverse types of excellence</li>
      <li><strong>Mastery-Based Advancement:</strong> Progress only after demonstrating competency</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>📚 Learning Philosophy</h3>
    <p>This course implements <em>mastery-based learning</em> where students advance based on 
    demonstrated competency rather than seat time. The gamification elements support 
    intrinsic motivation and provide clear feedback on progress toward mastery.</p>
