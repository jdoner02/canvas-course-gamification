## **⚡ Automated Deployment Workflow**

### **GitHub Integration Script**
```yaml
Workflow_Triggers:
  - Issue Creation with Tags
  - Tag Addition to Existing Issues
  - Project Board Card Assignment
  - Pull Request Labels
  - Discussion Topic Categories

Auto_Assignment_Logic:
  Step_1: "Parse issue tags and extract persona triggers"
  Step_2: "Check for multi-agent collaboration patterns"
  Step_3: "Assign primary and secondary agents based on priority"
  Step_4: "Create agent notification comments with context"
  Step_5: "Update project board with agent assignments"
  Step_6: "Set response time expectations based on priority"

Agent_Notification_Format:
  Template: |
    🤖 **AI Agent Auto-Assignment**
    
    **Primary Agent**: @{agent_persona}
    **Collaboration Team**: {secondary_agents}
    **Priority Level**: {priority_level}
    **Expected Response**: Within {response_time}
    **Focus Area**: {specialized_focus}
    
    **Agent Context**:
    - Issue Tags: {issue_tags}
    - Complexity Level: {complexity_assessment}
    - Educational Impact: {impact_level}
    
    **Next Steps**:
    1. Agent acknowledges assignment
    2. Initial assessment and questions
    3. Solution development begins
    4. Collaboration coordination (if multi-agent)
