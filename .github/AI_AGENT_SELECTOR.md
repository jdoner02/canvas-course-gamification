## **🔄 AGENT ACTIVATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Task Analysis**
```javascript
// Automatic persona detection based on keywords
function detectPersona(taskDescription) {
    const keywords = taskDescription.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);
    const personaScores = {};
    
    // Score each persona based on keyword matches
    for (const keyword of keywords) {
        if (UX_TAGS.includes(keyword)) personaScores.ux_designer = (personaScores.ux_designer || 0) + 1;
        if (SECURITY_TAGS.includes(keyword)) personaScores.security_specialist = (personaScores.security_specialist || 0) + 1;
        // ... continue for all personas
    }
    
    // Return highest scoring persona
    return Object.keys(personaScores).reduce((a, b) => personaScores[a] > personaScores[b] ? a : b);
}
```

### **Step 2: Context Loading**
Once your persona is assigned, load your specific knowledge:

```bash
# Load persona-specific knowledge
PERSONA=$(detect_persona "$TASK_DESCRIPTION")
echo "🤖 Activating AI Agent Persona: $PERSONA"

# Load specialized knowledge and protocols
source ".github/ai-personas/${PERSONA}.md"

# Initialize git workflow for autonomous commits
