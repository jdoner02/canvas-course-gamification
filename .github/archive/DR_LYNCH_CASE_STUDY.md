## ðŸŽ¯ Client Requests and Requirements

### Phase 1: Initial Consultation Simulation

**Dr. Lynch's Initial Request** (Simulated):
> "I've been teaching MATH 231 for several years using a flipped classroom approach with my YouTube videos. This summer I have a very diverse group of students from different majors, and I'd like to make the course more engaging and accessible. I've heard about gamification in education and would like to explore how to customize this Canvas framework for my specific needs."

### Phase 2: Requirements Gathering

**Follow-up Questions and Responses**:

**Q**: What specific challenges are you facing with the current course structure?  
**A**: "Students from different majors struggle to see the relevance of linear algebra to their fields. CS students want to see algorithms, EE students need signal processing applications, and cyber students are interested in cryptographic applications."

**Q**: How do you currently use your YouTube content?  
**A**: "I have organized playlists for different topics. Students watch videos before class, but I notice accessibility issues - some students need transcripts, and international students benefit from slower playback and summaries."

**Q**: What would success look like for this customization?  
**A**: "Students would have personalized learning paths based on their major, better accessibility support, and increased engagement through game-like elements while maintaining rigorous mathematical standards."

## ðŸš€ Project Implementation Roadmap
