# [CRITICAL BUG] ValidationResult object not subscriptable in deploy.py

**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** bug, critical, deployment, validation

## 🐛 Bug Description
Deployment fails due to improper handling of ValidationResult object in the deploy.py script.

## 🔄 Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `python deploy.py --config examples/linear_algebra --validate-only`
2. Validation passes but result processing fails
3. Error: `'ValidationResult' object is not subscriptable`

## ✅ Expected Behavior
Validation should complete and display results properly, allowing deployment to proceed.

## ❌ Actual Behavior
Script crashes with validation result handling error despite successful validation.

## 🎯 Impact Assessment
- [x] **Critical** - Blocks deployment/core functionality

## 🏷️ Component Areas
- [x] Canvas API Integration
- [x] Validation System

## 🔬 Technical Details
Error occurs in validation result processing around line ~325 in deploy.py.
The ValidationResult object structure has changed but the handling code expects a dictionary.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ValidationResult object properly handled
- [ ] Deployment validation completes successfully
- [ ] Error handling improved for validation failures
- [ ] Unit tests added for validation result processing

## 🎓 Educational Impact
**High** - Prevents course deployment to Canvas, blocking student access to gamified content.

## ⏱️ Estimated Effort
**2-4 hours** - Code review and validation object refactoring
