# [FEATURE] Complete end-to-end deployment automation

**Priority:** P1
**Labels:** feature, high, deployment, automation

## 🚀 Feature Description
Implement comprehensive deployment automation that handles the complete Canvas course setup process.

## 🎯 User Story
As an **instructor**, I want to **deploy a complete gamified course to Canvas with one command** so that **I can focus on teaching instead of technical setup**.

## 📋 Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] One-command deployment (`deploy.py --config examples/linear_algebra`)
- [ ] Automatic error recovery and rollback
- [ ] Progress tracking and detailed logging
- [ ] Canvas permissions validation
- [ ] Content verification post-deployment

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Deployment completes in <5 minutes for typical course
- [ ] 99.9% success rate for valid configurations
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages for failures
- [ ] Idempotent operations (safe to re-run)

## 🏗️ Technical Design
1. **Pre-deployment validation**
   - Canvas API connectivity
   - Course configuration integrity
   - Permission checks
2. **Deployment phases**
   - Course structure creation
   - Content upload and linking
   - Gamification setup
   - Accessibility verification
3. **Post-deployment verification**
   - Link validation
   - Content accessibility
   - Student view testing

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Instructor can deploy course with single command
- [ ] Deployment includes all 12 modules, 11 assignments, 30 outcomes
- [ ] Gamification elements (XP, badges) properly configured
- [ ] Skill tree progression working
- [ ] All accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## 🎓 Educational Impact
**Critical** - Enables faculty to deploy engaging, accessible courses efficiently.

## ⏱️ Estimated Effort
**1-2 weeks** - Complex integration with multiple systems
