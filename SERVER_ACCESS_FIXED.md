# Server Access Issue Resolution ✅

## Problem Solved
The HTTP 403 error was caused by **port conflict** - port 5000 was already in use by macOS Control Center (AirPlay service).

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Port Conflict Resolution
- **Issue**: Port 5000 was occupied by macOS Control Center/AirPlay
- **Solution**: Changed server port from 5000 to 8080 in `.env` file
- **Result**: Server now runs without conflicts

### 2. Host Configuration Update
- **Changed**: `HOST=0.0.0.0` → `HOST=127.0.0.1`
- **Reason**: More secure localhost binding for development
- **Result**: Proper local access without external exposure

### 3. Virtual Environment Activation
- **Issue**: Dependencies were installed in virtual environment but not activated
- **Solution**: Used `source venv/bin/activate` before running server
- **Result**: All Python packages now accessible

## ✅ Current Server Status

The Flask application is now running successfully:
